The algorithms and programs for this satellite evolution code, with
associated analysis routines, were developed over approximately a
thirty year interval 1991-2022.

The core integration algorithm was presented in:
"Symplectic Maps for the N-body Problem,"
J. Wisdom and M. Holman, 1991,
Astronomical Journal 102, 1528.

The rotational Lie-Poisson algorithm was presented in:
"Lie-Poisson Algorithms for Rigid Body Dynamics in the Solar System,"
J. Touma and J. Wisdom, 1993,
Astronomical Journal 107, 1189

Symplectic Correctors were presented in:
"Symplectic Correctors,"
J. Wisdom, with M. Holman and J. Touma, 1996,
Fields Institute Communications, 10, 217.

The hierarchical Jacobi coordinates were presented in:
G.J. Sussman and J. Wisdom, 2001, 2014
"Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics"
(MIT Press, Cambridge, 1st edition 2001, 2nd edition 2014)

The univeral Kepler solver was presented in:
"A Fast and Accurate Universal Kepler Solver without Stumpff Series,"
J. Wisdom and D. Hernandez, 2015
MNRAS 453, 3015.

The specific satellite evolution code was developed from 2019-2022 by
Jack Wisdom.
