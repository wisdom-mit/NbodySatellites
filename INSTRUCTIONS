The core integration program is nbody-satellites.
Programs that analyze results begin with analyze.

To compile them all use "make" or "make all"
To remove the executables "make clean".

To run an integration type
./nbody-satellites run-file >> run-file.out&

A run-file contains four lines:
ic-file-name
stepsize
steps-between-outputs
number-of-outputs

The ic-file-name contains the initial conditions:
2 ;ic file version number
G ; gravitational constant (determines units)
n ; index of the body that has satellites
px py pz ; rectangular components of the pole unit vector
I/MR^2 omega0 ; normalized moment of inertia and rotation rate
J2 J3 J4 J5 J6 Re ; gravitational harmonics and fiducial radius (for the Js as well as normalized moment)
satellite-mass-0 ; entered as a negative numner to indicate a satellite
planet-centered-satellite-0-rectangular-coordinates
planet-centered-satellite-0-rectangular-velocity
tidal-parameters-0
satellite-mass-1: as a negative number
... (as many satellites as are present)
mass-sun
sun-coordinates 
sun-velcity
mass-jupiter
jupiter-coordinates
jupiter-velocity
mass-saturn
saturn-coordinates
saturn-velocity
mass-uranus
uranus-coordinates
uranus-velocity
mass-neptune
neptune-coordinates
neptune-velocity

Except for the planet that has the satellites, the mass and
coordinates are the rectangular coordinates of the barycenter of the
planet and its satellites with respect to the solar system barycenter.
For the planet with the satellites, these are the rectangular
coordinates of the planet with respect to the barycenter of the solar
system.

Of course, the planets could be replaced by any planetary system.

Executing
./nbody-satellites run-file >> run-file.out&
produces a "mapping binary" output file run-file.mb.

If the integration is interrupted, running the same command continues
the integration.  If you want to start over you must remove the file
run-file.mb.
